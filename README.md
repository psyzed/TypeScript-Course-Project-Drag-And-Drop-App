A simple Drag and drop app written with typeScript.
Add a project to the list and then move it by drag-dropping it.

To use clone the repo
Run npm install to install all dependencies
Run npm start to start the local server
If your browser doesn't start automatically start it and visit http://localhost:3000/

Thank you!
